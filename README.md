# What was done in refactoring the code

I made sure to clean up the code in both the HTML and CSS for an easier time editing the code.
Semantic elements were used in replace of non-semantic elements.
Code in CSS was cleaned up by eliminating repetition within the code.
Made the title of the website something more eye catching and descriptive.
Added alt attributes to each image incase of an issue presenting the image.
